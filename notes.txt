Strategy for my new implementation of 'varbvs'
----------------------------------------------
* Variants of varbvs:
    (1) Quantitative response variable with 0+ covariates, including
        an intercept (family = gaussian). See varbvsnorm.m.
    (2) Binary response variable (0 or 1) with 0+ covariates, always
        includes an intercept (family = binomial). See varbvsbin.m.

* Options:
   (12) Summary statistics from "fixed" variational estimates for an
        external set of variables.

* The output of 'varbvs' is called 'fit'. It is a structure array
  (STRUCT) with the following fields:
    (1) Variational parameters 'alpha'.
    (2) Variational parameters 'mu'.
    (3) Variational parameters 's'.
    (4) Variational parameters 'eta' (logistic link only).

* See glmnet.m for a nice example of how to write detailed description
  of function.
  
* Does not currently allow for sparse matrices X.

* Give platform and MATLAB version used for testing.

* See here for some data sets that could be used for demos:
  http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i01

* To do: Double-check calculations of PVE against lm() in R.

* To do:
   - Write help for varbvsprint.m.
   - Write help for varbvscoefcred.m.
