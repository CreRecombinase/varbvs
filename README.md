#Variational inference for Bayesian variable selection implemented in MATLAB and R

###Introduction

This software package is a MATLAB implementation of the variational
inference procedure for Bayesian variable selection, as described in
the [Bayesian Analysis](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/) paper [Scalable
variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression,
and its accuracy in genetic association
studies](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2012/vol07/issue01/carbonetto.pdf)
(Bayesian Analysis 7, March 2012, pages 73-108).  This
software has been used to implement Bayesian variable selection for
large problems with over a million variables and thousands of samples.

_A few details about implementation of the MATLAB and R functions, in
particular what platform they were tested on, go here._
