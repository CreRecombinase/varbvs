#Variational inference for Bayesian variable selection implemented in MATLAB and R

###Introduction

This software package includes
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and
[R](http://www.r-project.org) implementations of the variational
inference procedure for Bayesian variable selection, as described in
the [Bayesian Analysis](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/) paper [Scalable
variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression,
and its accuracy in genetic association
studies](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2012/vol07/issue01/carbonetto.pdf)
(*Bayesian Analysis* 7, March 2012, pages 73-108). This software has
been used to implement Bayesian variable selection for large problems
with over a million variables and thousands of samples.

The MATLAB implementation has been tested in version 7.10 (R2010a) of
MATLAB for 64-bit Linux. An implementation for R is forthcoming.

This project includes several MATLAB functions created by James
P. LeSage as part of the [Econometrics
Toolbox](http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/) (March 2010 revision),
which is also distributed under the GNU General Public License. None
of MATLAB code from this toolbox has been modified. Also included
(without modification) is the MATLAB function rgb.m written by
