#Variational inference for Bayesian variable selection
#A library for MATLAB and R

###Introduction

This software package is a MATLAB implementation of the variational
inference procedure for Bayesian variable selection, as described in
the [Bayesian Analysis](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/) paper [Scalable
variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression,
and its accuracy in genetic association
studies](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2012/vol07/issue01/carbonetto.pdf).
This software has been used to implement Bayesian variable selection
for large problems with over a million variables.
