#Variational inference for Bayesian variable selection implemented in MATLAB and R

###Introduction

This software package is a MATLAB implementation of the variational
inference procedure for Bayesian variable selection, as described in
the [Bayesian Analysis](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/) paper [Scalable
variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression,
and its accuracy in genetic association
studies](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2012/vol07/issue01/carbonetto.pdf)
(Bayesian Analysis 7, March 2012, pages 73-108).  This
software has been used to implement Bayesian variable selection for
large problems with over a million variables and thousands of samples.

*A few details about implementation of the MATLAB and R functions, in
particular what platform they were tested on, go here.*

This project includes several MATLAB functions created by James
P. LeSage as part of the [Econometrics
Toolbox](http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/) (March 2010 revision),
which is also distributed under the GNU General Public License. None
of MATLAB code from this toolbox has been modified. Also included
(without modification) is the MATLAB function `rgb.m` written by
Kristján Jónasson.
