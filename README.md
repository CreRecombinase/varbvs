##Variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in MATLAB and R

###Introduction

This software package is a MATLAB implementation of the variational
inference procedure for Bayesian variable selection, as described in
the [Bayesian Analysis](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/) paper, *Scalable
variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression,
and its accuracy in genetic association studies.* This software has
been used to implement Bayesian variable selection for large problems
with over a million variables.
